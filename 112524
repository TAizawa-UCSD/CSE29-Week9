Processes: what is a process?　→ the memory, current instructions, and systemresources for a running program.

Process changes memory through code/instruction.    Not part of process: gcc before the program starts
Keeps track of system resources: sockets, stdin, stdout

How do we create and manage processes from aprogram?
pid_t fork()
coid execup(cmd,args) (manage/start/control)
What are apps that create + manage process?
- text editor 
- youtube(?) (process for Audio video vs. web page)
-> Can we isolate/limit a process?
- bash/terminal -> there are C programs!
- GradeScope autograder
