reg16: 64bits

add reg1, reg2 #add values in r1, r2 and store in r1

3 GHz means 3 billion "cycles" / sec
CPU instructions like "add" take ~~ 1 cycle, 10^-9 nanosecond
Memory instructions like "mov" take ~~ 10-100 cycles, 10^-7,8 nanoseconds (because memory is separated, and communication takes time)
SSD storage ~~ 1M cycles, 10^-3 sec | 1ms
HDD storage ~~ 10M cycles, 1/100 sec
